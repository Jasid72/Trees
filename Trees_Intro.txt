Terminology:
___________
1-> Root-> Topmost Node
2-> Parent-> Node which connect to the child
3-> Child-> Node which is Connected by another Node is its child
4-> Sibling-> Nodes belonging to the same parents.
5-> Leaf(External Node)->Node with no children
6-> Internal Node-> Node with one child
7-> Depth->No of edges from root to the Node
8-> Height-> No of edges from Node to the depth Leaf
9-> Ancestor-> Previous all Nodes of Leaf.
10-> Descendents-> Roots to the all Nodes.

            <---------------->
.Tree-> Non-Linear

We use tree for ideal representation hierarchical data.


Binary Tree:
___________
1-> Binary tree is a tree which has atleast 2 or 1 child.

    Types of Binary Tree:
    ____________________

        1->Full or strict Binary Tree:
            All Nodes have either 0 or 2 child.

        2-> Perfect Binary Tree:
            Internal Nodes have 2 child + All Leaf nodes are on same level.

        3-> Complete Binary Tree:
             Binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible
        4-> Degenerate Tree:
            Parent Node has exactly one child.

        5-> Skewed Tree:
            left Skewed-> All the node is on left side.
            Right Skewed-> All the Node is on right side.


Representation of Binary Tree:
_____________________________

1-> Array Representation(Not Useful):
2-> Linked Representation:

Traversal Binary Tree:
_____________________

1-> Preorder Traversal:
    Root->left sub-Tree -> Right sub-Tree
2-> PostOrder Traversal:
    left sub-Tree-> Right sub-Tree -> Root
3-> In order Traversal:
    Left sub-Tree -> Root -> Right sub-Tree
